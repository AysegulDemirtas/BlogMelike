# MVC-Blog
Make a Simple Blog

This is a repository which includes my Web Tecnologies Homework: MVC Blog.

In this project, I unfortunately can not connect any Model with my Controllers and Views. So my project can not take any data from databases. This means I have no Log in system for my blog application as you know. My blog consist of only some controller files, and some views. This Kitchen Blog has much many resources was taken from internet. The copyright of the texts in my blog does not belongs to me.
